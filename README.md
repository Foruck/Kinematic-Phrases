# Bridging the Gap between Human Motion and Action Semantics via Kinematic Phrases (ECCV 2024)

## KP Extraction

1. Download SMPL(X) models and put them in ``models``.
2. Run ``python kp.py`` to extract KP sequence corresponding to the sample motion sequence.

## TODOs

- [x] Kinematic Pharases list in `KP`.
- [x] Kinematic Prompt Generation (KPG) prompts in `kpg.txt`.
- [x] A data sample is available in `sample`.
- [x] Code for KP extraction.
- [ ] Code for KPG benchmarking.
- [ ] Code for Kinematic Phrases Base aggregation.
